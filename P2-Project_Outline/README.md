## sugar and caffiene fueled rant about cults, democracy, and psychological warfare -- skip to overview :)
Like many Americans, I believe that our democracy is in peril. The internet has changed our world and our future in incoprehensibly positive ways. It has also evolved much faster than consumers' and governments' ability to understand the implications it would have on our personal information and how it could be used in ways that are not in the collective interests of a democratic nation. Most notably for the context of this project, personally catered advertisements are of great benefit to consumers and our economy. They can, however, also be used for much more nefarious means. More and more, the media that we expose ourselves to (and that which we are exposed to) is shaping our world view. Humans are extremely prone to manipulation and psychological warfare. History is riddled with poingnant examples of how the personal adgendas of a few actors can inflict incredible damage on societies, families, and individuals. The Nazi movement, so with hundreds of cults, and more modern examples like ISIS and the Neo-Nazi movement, rely heavily on targetting suceptible individuals for their campaigns. And it works. The most modernt testament to this quagmire of brainwashing is the use of data in political campaigns that can cater issues, sentiments, policies, and adgendas to unbelievably nuanced levels based on hyper-individualized preferences. And our technology leaders have done little to thwart these malicious efforts. We are witnessing the inception of the first real psycological cyber warfare efforts now. Psycological manipulation exhibits a snowball effect on the individual and society writ large. Many of humanity's most iminent threats stem from these manipulative adgendas. And the effectiveness of their arsenal of tools is further subject to exponential growth of data, algorithms, computing power, and lack of regulation. It's up to each and every individual consumer to determine the credibility, adgena, and truthfulness of the content they are handed on a siver platter, which is derived from human-made algorithms which use their personal preferences calculated by gobs of their personal data. While it's said that our brains are the most complext object in the known universe, these organic processors did not evolve to consume, process, and interpret the amount of information foist upon us each an every day. But we are Humans, the use of tools is our single most defining super power which empowers us to conquer planets. Unfortunately, we have yet to posess a decent tool for this problem.

Tackling this issue is a tall order for the scope of a small project such as this. So how can we make the biggest dent with the short amount of time available? We need a simple tool that wields great power. Assuming we will continue to be force fed subjective content disguised as fair and balanced, is there a way to process that information in a truly objective way? How do we know what is true? Biased? Credible? It would be nice to have a single "lense" that could point these things out. Reddit, the front page of the internet, has attempted to do just this by providing avenues for collective user feedback. But upvotes and downvotes is a clunky tool to use for such a complicated problem. It behooves us to enable much more nuanced feedback than whether people like or agree with a particular media. A handful of studies have demonstrated that groups harness a collective intelligence that can increase accuracy of predictions, creativity in problem solving, and speed and efficiency in solving novel problems. Perhaps Reddit had the right idea, but botched the implementation. When I read an article, I want to know when a sentence is misleading, or untrue, or if the perspective of the article has a bias, and if so, what are the counter arguments. I don't want to have to spend all day researching the contents of a single article. But some people do... And they will be the arbiters of truth. With the wind at their backs, they can assemble a wikipedia-like effectiveness to summarizing quality content in a transparent and accessible way. I'm less interested in upvotes, and more interested in insightfulness, quality, accuracy, truthfulness, objectivity, and transparency. But our judgement can get clouded and our defenses lowered when we're in a familiar space. We tend to seek out the same watering hole each time we're thirsty for news. That is the place which we are familiar, comfortable, and seemingly safe. If We have the opportunity to pull our loved ones out from the cults of media and news, we must show them that saftey lies in transparency. It's there that true democratic outcomes manifest. 

### Concrete Overview:

One can think of this product as like Reddit. Frankly, the idea is quite similar. I believe that Reddit has stopped innovating their product before it's reached maturation. Simple upvotes and downvotes fails to capture the nuance of why users choose to rate the articles in the first place. Comment threads add a dimension of this, but it requires further reading and filtering of user comments. This project will focus on "crowdsourced proofreading of media, providing tools for objective analysis, and summarizing the sentiments of the masses." Instead of simply viewing the number of upvotes and reading through a dozen comments, a user can view the "proofreading comments" as they read the article itself. The more a particular sentence in an article has been highlighted by users, the more prominent the sentence will be highlighted on the site. When that sentence is hovered over, the reader can view a summary of the user feedback in the form of "upvotes" in various categories as well as user comments sorted by similar "upvotes". After some time, we can aggregate the article ratings to analyze authors and news outlets as well, further providing transparency to vital insights such as "how well-cited is this author?" "How biased is this author or news outlet?" "what percentage of content produced is opinion based (subjective) rather than fact based (objective)?" "is this source generally credible?" By hosting authors' reputations, we can 1) incentivize the more noble characteristics of ethical journalism and media and 2) establish ourselves as the gold standard for such ratings and 3) gain a foothold as a trustworthy place to gather news in the first place. Users will become accustomed to this form of guided reading, thus incentivizing them to navigate away from their google, facebood, and apple news feeds... Even the term "feed" should be a red flag to anyone paying attention. I should move that last sentence to the previous section. 

### Features
Proof of Concept:

1) Search and sort: Users will be able to search for articles on a given topic, or sort the list of articles on a homepage by categories they are rated on and categories they are classified as. 

2) Rate and categorize content: At the end of each article, users will have the ability to rate, from 0 to 10, the article as a whole on categories that pertain to the credibility, factualness, opinionatedness, bias, etc. Eventually, categories can be created by users. They will categorize the topics of the articles as well. 

3) Proof read: A reader will be able to proof-read each article. If a senence, quote, or reference is questionable, they will be able to conduct their own research and add references to substantiate or debunk a particular statement within an article. They can add comments and rate that particular statement. 

4) Author and Source ratings: eventually, enough data will have been collected on the articles that the ratings and categories can be used to rate individual authors on their content. This will be avilable to users for added transparency on the bias and opinionatedness of the authors and sources. Their reputations as credible, factual, etc. will be on display for the world to see. 

5) Submit articles and submit ratings to a database.

MVP:

6) User Profiles and Gamification: Users of the site will have an incentive to proof read articles by gamifying the site so they are rewarded with tokens and reputation for quality feedback. 

7) Analytics: Each article on the site will have a collection of these data points that will be aggregated into scores. A later generation of this feature will be capable of predicting these metrics and summarizing the article, as well as summarizing the user comments of an article. 

8) The statements that have been highlighted by users the most will be color coded and the user comments and links will be accessible.

Possibilities:

Over time, we will collect enough data to use machine learning algorithms to better predict the categories of each article. Eventually, it will be essential that machines can predict the credibility, bias, and opinionatedness of articles that are posted on the internet. This will be a powerful tool for combating, trolls, tyrants, cults, and cyber warfare as a whole. 

### Technologies
Proof of Concept:
IntelliJ: IDE used for programming.
Springboot with Thymeleaf: this will streamline communication with the backend.
Java: this will be used for server-side programming
PHP MyAdmin: Used for database management. We will store averything pertinant to the website except for the contents of the articles themselves.

MVP:
RaspberryPi: this will be used to store the database
Java Script: This will be the language used for updating the webpage, front-end functionality, and the browser. 
Python: this will be used for all data processing and analytics. 
JSON: allows an extension (plugin) to communicate with the browser. 

### What I'll Have to Learn
Proof of Concept:
-I will need to get very comfortable with database managementa and SQL in order to process and store the tables/data that I wish to store. The proof of concept product will give me a springboard for the MVP.
-I will need to learn how to allow a user to highlight a sentence, type a comment, and store both in a table related to the article. 

MVP:
-I'll need to learn how to configure a Raspberry Pi to be used for a database. 
-I will need to learn enough Java Script to get this site operational. 
-This may ultimately be a browser plugin that "lays over" the browser. This will require JSON.
